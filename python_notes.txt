#Here are naming conventions for Python identifiers :
  -Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.
  -Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.
  -Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.
  -If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.

#IDLE is just a shell with python running. Ctrl+C kills the process

#python blocking is by indentation. if you don't have your spacing right, your program wont run right.

#when running from Windows CMD (with python on PATH) : python script_file_name.py <input parameters>

#when running from Linux :
$chmod +x test.py     # This is to make file executable
$./test.py
